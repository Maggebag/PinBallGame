The goal of this project is to make a pinball game using bullet physics engine, and threepp for visualising the game.

#### Progress so far
* Very little
* Made functioning flippers in the physicsTest, aswell as testing the "simulated" gravity
* Started structuring code after getting a good understanding of basic functions

#### Todo
* Make the entire scene in a struct similar to "SnakeGame" in threepp examples
* Figure out a good and efficient way of making the board in which the game is played
