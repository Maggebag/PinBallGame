## Pinball Game using Bullet3 physics engine


#### Example image
![img.png](doc/pictures/pinballgameExample.png)

#### Todo:
* Write good and meaningful tests aswell as code that can be tested
* Want to do a point scoring system for hitting different things on the playing field, however this is not a top priority

#### No tests for bullet....
Write some meaningfull text here about why not.

#### Any class is not split into hpp declaration and cpp definition

For some reason whenever I try to split any class into a hpp declaration and cpp definition I get linker errors. (LNK 2005)
And for the life of me I cannot figure out how to fix this.
So for the meantime a bit longer compiling times and everything is in header files. 
I suspect it has something to do with how I am implementing bullet and using it in different functions in classes.
